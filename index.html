        <h1>3 Basic Logic Gates</h1>
        <hr>

        <h3><i>NOT Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The <b>NOT</b> gate is about as basic as it gets.  It takes in one boolean input, and inverts it to make its output.<p>
        <hr>

        <h3><i>OR Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The <b>OR</b> gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if at least one of those inputs are true, it outputs true.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3><i>AND Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The <b>AND</b> gate takes in two boolean inputs, and only if both of the inputs are true, it outputs true.  <br>It's comprised of two <b>NOT</b> gates leading into an <b>OR</b> gate followed by another <b>NOT</b> gate.</p>
