        <h3><i>NOT Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The NOT gate is about as basic as it gets.  It takes one boolean input, and inverts it to make its output.<p>
        <hr>

        <h3><i>OR Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The OR gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if at least one of those inputs are true, it outputs true.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3><i>AND Gate</i></h3>
        <p>The AND gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if only if both of the inputs are true, it outputs true.  <br>It's comprised of two NOT gates leading into an OR gate followed by another NOT gate.</p>
