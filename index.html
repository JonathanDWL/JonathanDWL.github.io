        <h3>NOT Gate</h3>
        <p>The NOT gate is about as basic as it gets.  It takes a boolean input, and inverts it to make its output.<p>

        <h3>OR Gate</h3>
        <p>The OR gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if at least one of those inputs are true, it outputs true.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>AND Gate</h3>
        <p>The AND gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if only if both of the inputs are true, it outputs true.  It's comprised of two NOT gates leading into an OR gate followed by another NOT gate.</p>
