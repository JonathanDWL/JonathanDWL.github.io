        <h3><span class = bluify><i>NOT Gate</i></span></h3>
        <p>The <span class = bluify><b>NOT</b></span> gate is about as basic as it gets.  It takes in one boolean input, and inverts it to make its output.<p>

        <h3><span class = bluify><i>OR Gate</i></span></h3>
        <p>The <span class = bluify><b>OR</b></span> gate takes in two boolean inputs, and if at least one of those inputs are true, it outputs true.</p>

        <h3><span class = bluify><i>AND Gate</i></span></h3>
        <p>The <span class = bluify><b>AND</b></span> gate takes in two boolean inputs, and only if both of the inputs are true, it outputs true.  <br>It's comprised of two <span class = bluify><b>NOT</b></span> gates leading into an <span class = bluify><b>OR</b></span> gate followed by another <span class = bluify><b>NOT</b></span> gate.</p>
